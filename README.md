# Employee Directory

This project is designed to allow a user to sort, view and filter employees from a sample API database. As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Project Info
The employee directory uses information from the Randomuser.me API to generate information about various 'employees', which can be sorted alphabetically, by age, or searched by employee name.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
